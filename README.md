# üñºÔ∏è Object Recognition with ResNet50

Welcome to the **Object Recognition** project! In this project, we explore the fascinating world of deep learning and computer vision by building a powerful image classification model using the **ResNet50** architecture. By leveraging this state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, our model achieves high accuracy in recognizing and classifying objects from images.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust object recognition system capable of identifying objects from various categories in a dataset of over **5000 images**. Through the power of transfer learning and fine-tuning, we successfully boost our model's accuracy from **47% to an impressive 93%**.

### Key Features:
- **Pretrained ResNet50**: Leveraged transfer learning with the pretrained ResNet50 model to accelerate training.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **93% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
- **5000+ Images Dataset**: Utilized a large dataset from **Kaggle** for training and validation.
- **Image Augmentation**: Applied data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to enhance model generalization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Core language for development
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training the ResNet50 model
- **NumPy**, **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **OpenCV**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For image processing and visualization

## üìä Data Overview

The dataset consists of over **5000 labeled images** belonging to different object categories. Key steps include:
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing images and normalizing pixel values
- **Augmentation**: Augmenting images to prevent overfitting
- **Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and validation sets

## üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow
